# Implementation and Pentesting of a Water Irrigation Simulation

This is a California State University Channel Islands Capstone project by Charlie Hernandez and Zachary Drake.

The purpose of this project is to implement a water irrigation system using open source software. Temperature, humidity, and moisture will be simulated in python, and the irrigation system will be implemented in OpenPLC - an open-source PLC IDE. The PLC program will be hosted on Raspberry Pi that will act as our PLC, and our python simulation will communicate with the Pi over a network using the Modbus protocol.

Once the system is fully implemented, penetration tests will be conducted to experiment with how vulnerable it is on our network.

Technologies used:

Python3, Ladder Diagrams, Raspberry Pi, OpenPLC, Modbus Protocol, SCADABr
